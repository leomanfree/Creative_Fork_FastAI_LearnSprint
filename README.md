# 🧠 Creative Fork — FastAI Learn Sprint

This repo documents my hands-on journey through the FastAI course, remixing the official notebooks with a creative and narrative twist.

## 📓 Day 1: Pet Breed Classifier 🐶🐱

Built a deep learning image classifier using `fastai` to identify 37 breeds of cats and dogs.  
Trained a ResNet model with transfer learning, visualized results, and tested on a custom image.

### ✅ Achievements
- Loaded and preprocessed Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset
- Trained a ResNet34 with `cnn_learner`
- Fine-tuned learning rate with `lr_find`
- Visualized top losses and confusion matrix
- Tested on custom image: nailed the prediction `shiba_inu` with 91% confidence 🔥

### 🧪 Next Steps
- Add more custom images for inference
- Experiment with data augmentation
- Try another architecture (like EfficientNet)
